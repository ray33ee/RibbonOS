 - Use constexpr to calculate baud rate at compile time (using const int clock_speed, defined for both raspberry pi models)
 - Modify Makefile to compile kernels for both types of raspberry pi (making kernel and kernel7) by passing MODEL_1 and recompiling each time
 - Modify allocation algorithm from first-fit to buddy's system
